My name is Julian, I am 17 years old, and I have a deep passion for music, gaming, TV shows, and anime. However, my true passion lies in programming and information technology. I love logical challenges that require creative thinking to solve. I completed a technical course at IFSC in Jaraguá do Sul, where I had the opportunity to learn and develop skills in programming and project development. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at the Catholic University of Jaraguá do Sul.
